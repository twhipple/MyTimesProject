What does your project do? Share the vision of the need that your project is trying to meet.

How is it set up? If someone were to pick up your codebase today how would they get everything 
running in their local environment.

How is it used? Once it's up and running provide some very descriptive examples of usage.

Is it in good shape? Do you have code climate, codeship, or other tools running to indicate
the health of the project? Include information on dependencies as well.

How can others help? Collaboration yields amazing software. Make it easy for others to get 
involved by letting them know how to submit new features, report issues, or offer other assistance.

License information Don't forget to let others know what license your project is released under. Not 
sure? Oreilly has an open book on understanding licensing.
